As in the UCR Time Series Archive, each of the data sets comes in two parts,
a TRAIN partition and a TEST partition.

For example, for the dataset AR1 we have two files, AR1_TEST.csv and AR1_TRAIN.csv.

Unlike UCR, these files are in .csv format.

As in the Time Series Archive of the UCR, there is a sample of series
times per row. The first value in the row is the class label (a number
integer between 1 and the number of classes). The rest of the row are the sample values
of data. The order of the time series instance is random.

The script with which the data was generated is the one named arima_sim-dataset.html, which is also
located inside this same folder.
